Super Mario
--------------

This is a simplistic spoof on the Super Mario Bros. Games.

The game is simple : get to the finish line by jumping across
brick platforms and killing Koopas. The finish line will be signified
by a blue bar.

Kill Koopas in two ways -- by jumping on them, or by bumping a brick below them.

Collect power-ups by bumping item blocks. Power-ups give you an extra life,
so when you are hit by a Koopa, you don't die immediately.

When in the level selection mode, press backspace to get back to the menu.

You can also easily create your own maps. All maps were created
from a text file. Check the constants for what each object in Super Mario
represents.

Also, there is a save file that determines what levels the player can access. The file, levelBeaten.txt, stores what level the player is on. Levels higher than this number are unavailable to the player -- the player
must first beat subsequent levels to get to a higher one. Currently, 
you can access all levels. But set the number in the text file to 1, and the player must start playing from level 1 (no other levels will be available to him).

HOW TO MOVE:
use the arrow keys: Right and left move mario horizontally.
                    Up makes mario jump.

NOTE: Be sure to release the up key if you want mario to move horizontally
      after a jump. (This is because java doesn't support multiple key 			     presses)
